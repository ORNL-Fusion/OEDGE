c     This block contains the DIVIMP declarations of IKXYS ...          
c     The definitions between OUT and DIVIMP were allowed to            
c     diverge so that the memory overhead that these variables          
c     incur (which can be substantial for high-resolution arrays)       
c     will not impact both programs. It is important to ensure          
c     that MAXGXS and MAXGYS are greater than or equal to               
c     the corresponding MAXNXS and MAXNYS.
