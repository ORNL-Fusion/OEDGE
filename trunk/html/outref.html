    <A HREF="#outskel">Appendix A: SKELETON DATAFILE for OUT</A>
    </pre> 
    </DIV> 
    
    <P> </P>   

    <H2><A NAME="outref">The OUT Reference Manual</A></H2>
    
    <P>The OUT input data file contains the specifications for a variety of
      different plots. Many of the inputs to these simply consist of either the
      ionisation state to be plotted or the ring number (for plots along a
      contour line) or both. In addition, the first entries in the file contain
      some general details and options that may apply to some or all of the
      plots. The LOS plots and the ADAS based plots both require additional
      lines of data defining either the line of sight and viewing scope in the
      case of the LOS plots or the data regarding which section of the ADAS
      atomic physics package is to be accessed in the case of the ADAS plots.
      Some plots require both sets on ancillary information and will accordingly
      be followed by two additional lines of data. Descriptions of the contents
      of these lines can be found under plot 201 for the LOS cases and under
      plot 125 for ADAS.</P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="title">Title</A></H3>
    
    <P>Enter a title line for the OUT case that is being run. This item is not
      actually used anywhere and is just here for reference perhaps in
      describing the types of plots that are requested in this particular OUT
      data file. The title specified for the DIVIMP run is passed over to OUT
      and used instead of this one as the title of the various plots.</P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="xygrid">XY Grid Source</A></H3>
    
    <P>This option tells the OUT program either to calculate the XY indexing
      grids or to read them in from a file. In the past, this XY grid was used
      in DIVIMP to facilitate following the neutral impurity particles. However,
      these XY grids are no longer used for normal operation and running of
      DIVIMP on grids for which polygon information is available. They are now
      only used to make the plotting routines easier in OUT, and so the code to
      calculate these was moved to the OUT program. A value of zero indicates
      that OUT should calculate the grids and a value of 99 indicates that they
      should be read from an attached data file. As in DIVIMP, this file is
      normally attached to FORTRAN unit 13 if the file is in use. This option is
      usually set to 0. (Note: The XY grid is an evenly spaced rectangular grid
      that covers the entire plasma region. It is used in some cases to map
      contour plots for passing to the plotting routines.</P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="column">Column Data for XY plots (0 = off, 1 = on)</A></H3>
    
    <P>This directive instructs OUT to write the plot data for XY plots (as
      opposed to contour plots) out to a file, rather than generating a plot for
      it. This is useful when extracting data from multiple cases for inclusion
      on one plot or for extracting the output data for use in a spreadsheet or
      if it is necessary to look at the actual numbers because the plot does not
      effectively display the information.</P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="plrps">PLRP Source Option (0-standard, 1-ADAS)</A></H3>
    
    <P>The calculation of PLRPs (Particular Line Radiation Profiles) used to be
      performed in DIVIMP. This code was moved to OUT since it seemed more
      appropriate that it be included as part of the post-processor. This switch
      selects between using the original DIVIMP code to calculate the PLRPs -
      which is based on a set of coefficients that are hard-coded in the PLRP
      module - and the use of alternative code that calculates a limited number
      of PLRPs by using the ADAS pls files. Currently, the only lines supported
      by the ADAS option are for Boron. This option does NOT affect the function
      of the plots that ask for additional ADAS data in order to generate the
      plots - it ONLY affects options with the PLRP module itself - which
      controls the information that is placed into the PLRPS array.</P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="expfact">Exponential Factor for test function (0.0 =
      off)Exponential Factor for test function (0.0 = off)</A></H3>
    
    <P>This option was used to test some plot options by assigning a decaying
      exponential to the set of values to be plotted as a function of S. i.e.
      f(S) = exp( - fact * S). A value of zero turns this off. It is only
      operational in combination with some of the regular and log plots of
      impurity density along the field lines. </P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="smooth">Number of smoothing weights (0-100)Number of
      smoothing weights (0-100)</A></H3>
    
    <P>For use in weighted averages smoothing technique, similar to that of
      LIM. Smoothing may only apply to a limited selection of graphs.</P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="divvol">Divertor Volume Limit Zd Divertor Volume Limit Zd</A></H3>
    
    <P>This specifies a Z extent for the divertor region. All values of Z less
      than the given value are outside the divertor region for an X-point up
      configuration. This is used to generate the plot of density versus the
      reference line for the areas outside the divertor region. (For an X-point
      down configuration, the region of Z &gt; Zd specifies the area away from
      the Divertor.) </P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="conttype">Contour Plot Type (0 = contour, 1 = false
      colour)Contour Plot Type (0 = contour, 1 = false colour)</A></H3>
    
    <P>This option applies to generating contour plots. It generates a false
      colour plot of bin densities instead of the usual contour plot. This is
      useful because the resolution of the simulation is no better than the grid
      underlying it and the false colour plot may suppress misleading trends due
      to the effects of the underlying XY grid on the contour plot. When plotted
      in black and white the false colour is implemented by changing half-tone
      densities and fill patterns. Also, when plotting false colour in black and
      white, it has been found that the best option for the number of
      contours/false colour scales is 7.</P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="contmeth">Contour Level Calculation Method</A></H3>
    
    <P>There are a number of methods available for calculating the
      levels/values at which the contour lines will be drawn. There are 4
      options currently supported.</P>
    
    <P>Contour Level Option 0: Contour Levels are calculated using a Quadratic
      formula.</P>
    
    <P><IMG HEIGHT="53" WIDTH="281" SRC="images/outref-1.gif"></P>
    
    <P>Contour Level Option 1: Contours are placed at the 10% levels.</P>
    
    <P><IMG HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="461" SRC="images/outref-2.gif"></P>
    
    <P>Contour Level Option 2: Contours are logarithmic based on powers of 2.
    </P>
    
    <P><IMG HEIGHT="58" WIDTH="210" SRC="images/outref-3.gif"></P>
    
    <P>Contour Level Option 3: User Defined. The contour routine will use the
      set of contour levels specified in the input file. These values are
      specified as a list of numbers in the range (0,1]. The description of this
      entry is found below. </P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="numcont">Number of Contour Lines</A></H3>
    
    <P>This general entry specifies the number of contour lines or the number

      standard format for reading a real array into DIVIMP. The entry in the
      data file consists of a descriptive line that is a character value
      followed by a line that contains an integer. This integer value line
      specifies how many contour levels should be read from the input data file.
      This number and the values read will replace the number specified in the
      previous entry for the number of contour lines. The numbers should be
      listed in ascending order and the last entry should be 1.0.</P>

    <P>This is a simple switch specifying whether close-up plots near the
      target will be printed for along the ring plots if they are available for
      the various plot options. </P>
    
    <P>Zoom Plot Option 0: Off - Do not do close ups of the near-target regions
      for along rings plots.</P>
    
    <P>Zoom Plot Option 1: On - If close ups of the near target regions are
      available for an along ring plot then they will be plotted. The value used
      for the zoom or magnification is specified in the next entry. </P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="zoonran">Range for Zoom</A></H3>
    
    <P>This input specifies the range to be plotted on the close-up or zoom
      plots. It is specified as a fraction of SMAX for the specific ring being
      plotted. For example, an input value of 0.1 would select plots along the
      ring over the close-up plotting ranges of [0,0.1 * SMAX ] and [0.9 * SMAX,
      SMAX]. Similarly an input value of 0.01 would produce near target plots of
      the regions [0.0,0.01 * SMAX] and [0.99 * SMAX, SMAX]. These close ups are
      available for many but not all of the along the ring plots. </P>

    <P>One of the contour plot options is to select a near X-point region for

      plotted. The R-range that is shown on the near X-point plots is Rx +/-
      Rrange = [Rx-Rrange,Rx+Rrange]. This may be modified on a particular grid
      to maximize the grid area displayed. </P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="zrange">Z-range for Near X-point plots </A></H3>
    
    <P>One of the contour plot options is to select a near X-point region for

    <H3><A NAME="scalef">Scale Factor</A></H3>
    
    <P>This defines the scaling factor that is applied to some plots. A value
      of 1.0 leaves all plots as they would normally be produced. A scale factor
      of &#150;1.0 sets the scaling factor to the ABSFAC source strength
      calculated in DIVIMP. A value for the scale factor greater than 0.0 sets
      the scaling factor to that value and a value for the scale factor less
      than 0.0 set the scale factor to be ABSFAC/|Scale factor|.</P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="zvalue">Z-Value for Plots vs. R</A></H3>
    
    <P>This number is the Z-coordinate used when LOS plots are selected to be
      plotted vs. the R-coordinate instead of angle. The R-coordinate used for a
      specific plotting angle is determined by the intersection of that angle
      with the value of Z specified here. </P>

    <H3><A NAME="exptds">Experimental DataSet for Specific Plot</A></H3>

    <P> Some plots have the ability to include experimental datasets in the 
      figure. Most of these routines have an input specifier that indicates
      which experimental dataset should be included. However, some of the 
      older plots did not have this ability. In order to add this capability
      for some of these plots - this general input specifies an experimental
      data set that should be plotted in addition to the calculated data if
      the feature is available for the plot. Only one dataset can be specified
      in this manner for these types of plots for any one input file.</P>
    
    <H2><A NAME="plotdesc">Individual Plot Descriptions</A></H2>
    
    <P>There are a wide variety of plotting options available from the OUT
      package. Many of the plots (e.g. the LOS plots) can be configured to
      replicate the actual functioning of a specific reactor diagnostic. Others
      can provide information that can not be obtained from any reactor
      diagnostic and can lead to a better understanding of what may be occurring
      within the reactor (e.g. the leakage plots). </P>
    
    <P>In the following numbering system for plots there a few common ideas and
      a number of exceptions. Here are a few of these. The even numbered contour
      plots are usually used to specify the near X-point plots, while the odd
      numbers will give the entire grid. (e.g. 11,12). Even numbered along the
      ring plots will often request the plot to be made as a function of the
      poloidal distance P rather than the along the field line distance S.
      Furthermore, many of the contour plots will accept only the one value of
      input - this usually is the ionisation state of the species to be plotted
      - or in some cases - a simple on/off switch. For these types of plots - a
      value of &#147;99&#148; turns them off. The other type accepts a 0,1
      off/on switch where 0 is off and 1 is on. Many of these will have extra
      plotting information included in the character string describing the plot.
      This may define the ionisation state or the ring to be plotted. </P>
    
    <P>Overall, the best way to select a plot is to examine an already working
      plot file and look at the options that are set there and how they are set.
      Some examples are included in the following document. </P>
    
    <P>* A new feature has been added as a plot input. If the 4th character in
      the plot specification is an &#147;&amp;&#148; the code will read the
      block of text from position 24 to 44 and try to extract 4 numbers. These 4
      numbers will be used to calculate the visible plotting range for 2D
      contour plots. This mechanism is useful to obtain close-up contour plots
      of specific portions of the grid. The four number are interpreted as
      follows &#150; Xcenter Xcenter Dx Dy. The contour plot will then be
      produced displaying a range of
      [Xcenter-Dx:Xcenter+Dx,Ycenter-Dy:Ycenter+Dy].</P>

    <P>The first three digits are a blank index number for the routine that
      generally reads in the entries in the data file. The next entry '/u/adas/ldh'
      specifies a directory (for a UNIX environment or a USER ID on the JET mainframe) where the
      ADAS data can be found (A &#145;*&#146; can be used to indicate that the
      default ADAS central database is to be utilized for the calculations).
      This entry can easily be adjusted for a mainframe environment by having this
      string set to the mainframe user ID where the data can be found. The next number specifies
      which year of the ADAS data should be used and the following string specifies which
      subset of the ADAS data for this element in this year should be accessed.
      The next three numbers are ADAS specific indices that specify which data is to be
      retrieved from the ADAS database. The first (ISELE) is a selector number
      which identifies the data block corresponding to emission due to
      excitation. If ISELE = 0 then emission from this process is set to zero.
      The next selector (ISELR) identifies the data block corresponding to
      emission due to recombination. If ISELR = 0 then emission from this
      process is set to zero. Finally, the third selector (ISELX) identifies the
      data block corresponding to emission due to charge exchange. If ISELX = 0
      then the emission from this process is set to zero. The fourth specifier is 
      an OUT program value (ISELD) that is an index into an experimental data file for
      the specific case and shot being examined. If this value is non-zero then OUT will
      plot the experimental result referred to by this index on the same plot as the
      calculated result.</P>

      <P> Plots 135 to 138 are the same as 125 to 128 - the difference is that the units 
      of the contours are in photons/s - total emission - rather than emission density as

    <P>The set of plots in the 200 series represent a change from the typical
      plots produced by the other options. All of the 200 series have a
      reasonably standard input. The only difference is the quantity being
      examined. The unique feature of the 200 series plots is that they
      represent a LOS integrated observation of the various quantities based on
      the modelling results stored in the various data arrays. These plots thus
      model the observations of specific quantities from specific observation
      positions and instruments. This allows the modelling results to be
      compared directly with the actual experimental observations perhaps giving
      some further insight into the processes taking place. There are two plots
      of each type, the first uses a LOS integration method dependent on an
      underlying evenly spaced XY grid which although less exact, will work when
      only incomplete available about the R,Z bin system. The second set of LOS
      integration routines utilises the bin vertices and a path-length in bin
      calculation to yield the contribution to the LOS integral for a particular
      line segment. This should yield more accurate results at the cost of not
      being useable by all the shot geometries available to DIVIMP. In addition,
      the second type of PLRP plots also utilise the ADAS package for the atomic
      physics data and thus require an additional input line as described under
      plot 126. The specifications for either one of these otherwise plots
      requires two lines. The meaning of the various parameters is described
      below.</P>
    
 <PRE>'201 Density LOS plot - Vertical KT1        '     0</PRE>

<P> The data line is interpreted as one of the following:</P>

<P> For 201 based series LOS plots:</P>

<pre>
    R Z A dA dR  npts avpts smoth izmin izmax norm</P>
</pre>

<P> For 206 based series LOS plots:</P>

<pre>
    R Z A dA Res npts avpts smoth izmin izmax norm</P>
</pre>

<P>The difference is the interpretation of the fourth input parameter - for 201 series plots this
is interpreted as the integration step size along each LOS - which is necessary for plots
that do not take advantage of the polygonal grid. However, for 206 series plots, this 
parameter is interpreted as the instrument width or resolution. Each signal data point that
is plotted is generated by averaging over "smoth" individual lines of sight distributed 
evenly over an angular width of size "Res" which is centered on the viewing angle for the current
point being calculated. The following paragraphs describe the other parameters in more detail.</P>
    
    <P>The number on the first line can take one of three values (0,1,2). Zero
      turns the plot off, 1 will generate an unnormalized plot and 2 will
      generate a plot with values normalized to a maximum of 1.0. R and Z
      represent the observation position of the instrument, relative to the
      co-ordinate system in which the plasma grid is defined. &quot;A&quot;
      represents the angle for the initial point of the plot (in degrees),
      relative to the positive R axis - which would be zero. &quot;dA&quot; is
      the width (again in degrees) between each of the points to be plotted. &quot;dR&quot;
      is the step size radially out from the observation position which will be
      used for the integration. Npts specifies the number of points to be
      plotted - thus the maximum angle is A + npts * dA. &quot;Avpts&quot; is
      the number of LOS integrations that are made and their results averaged to
      produce the value for each plotted point. A LOS integration involves
      stepping along an observation path at steps of size dR until all
      contributions across the plasma have been included. The reason to have
      multiple chords for each point is so that significant contributions from
      small areas far from the instrument will not be missed - however the
      result is integrated and averaged in a manner similar to an expected
      instrument operation so that the results can (hopefully) be expected to
      bear some reasonable relationship to reality. The &quot;smoth&quot;
      quantity allows for the results to be further smoothed by averaging the
      values of consecutive points to produce a modified value for the central
      point. This quantity specifies the number of such points to take into the
      average. The quantities izmin and izmax specify the limits of the
      ionization states to be plotted on the graph. Finally, the quantity norm
      specifies one of four possible normalization options to allow the absolute
      values of the data to conform to the experimental results - depending on
      what type of instrument is in use. The four scale factors options
      currently in use are:</P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="norm200">Normalization Options for 200 series plots</A></H3>
    
    <P>Option 0: No scale factor applied.</P>
    
    <P>Option 1: Data multiplied by delta(theta) / (2.0 * PI)</P>
    
    <P>Option 2: Data multiplied by 1.0 / (2.0 * PI)</P>
    
    <P>Option 3: Data multiplied by 1.0 / (4.0 * PI)</P>
    
    <P><B>Note:</B> For many of these LOS plots there are two choices (e.g.
      201 or 206) that will generate the same plot. This is due to two distinct
      and parallel implementations for calculating the LOS plots. In general,
      the &#145;6&#146; plots utilise an algorithm for integration that relies
      on the existence of an underlying polygonal grid. This was not always the
      case for DIVIMP. As such, the original routines (201,231 ...) will work
      with or without a polygonal grid. They are still compatible with the cell
      centred based grids for which DIVIMP was originally implemented. These
      plot options are still included for compatibility with these older grids.
      In general, it is probably better to use the LOS plots that are based
      directly on the polygonal grid structure. However, either type of plot
      should work. Please note that in the case of radiation based plots
      involving particular line radiation, there is no exact match in the
      plotting routines. The routines that use the newer methods of calculating
      the LOS integrals also use ADAS to calculate the radiation. Similarly, the
      older integration routines are not available for ADAS based radiation
      data.</P>

    <H3><A NAME="plot331">Generalized LOS plots over a variety of quantities (331)</A></H3>

    <P> Plot 331 is a generalized LOS plot. Each and every chord of the LOS integration can 
    be independenly specified in terms of location, angle, angular width and total line 
    length over which the integration should take place. This routine can be used to 
    model both LOS type diagnostics as well as generate integrated signal plots spaced 
    along any set of viewing lines. The details of the input are described in the comments 
    from the input file that are listed below. </P>

    <P> At present there are seven different quantities that may be selected for
    integration - this will likely increase as more useful quantities are found. In addition, this 
    plot can be used as a substitute for almost all of the LOS integration plots that currently 
    exist in the OUT program and at a future revamp of the OUT code - they may all be replaced
    by the code for this routine. </P>

    <P> The following os the list of available quantities:</P>

       <LI>  1 = H POWER LOSS    ISTATE = 0,1 (<0 >1)

    $ The code expects data for NPTS lines of sight. If any of nr,nz,nt,ndt,
    $ or nd are less than NPTS then the code uses the last values (e.g. DTndt) 
    $ for all remaining lines of sight. This means that if one or more of the
    $ quantities is exactly the same for all lines of sight - it needs to
    $ only be specified once. Thus to produce lines of sight similar to the 
    $ previous LOS code one would specify a varied set of T-Values while
    $ supplying only one value for each of the other inputs.

    <P> These plots use the multiple plot per page utilities to 
    produce a set of plots intended to compare OSM data sampled
    from a specific cross-section of the grid to a set of 
    experimental data that were taken by a probe operating at the
    equivalent position in the actual reactor. </P>

    <P> The direct comparison of the results may not coincide however
    due to problems with the magnetic grid not actually matching the 
    experimental locations of the actual magnetic flux surfaces. These
    differences are compensated for by allowing an offset to be imposed. 
    This offset shifts the horizontal scale of the experimental data.</P>

    <P> Each set of plots includes the four quantities Ne, Te, Ti and Pressure
    comparing the OSM and RP results. Plot 353 is the same as 351 except
    that it contains 16 plots showing each of the four quantities at four 
    different values of the offset.</P>

    <P>I believe this produces a 3-D toroidal projection of a viewing line
      cutting through the torus toroidally for the PIN H-Alpha emission. It
      projects the 2-D poloidal results which are obtained from the DIVIMP and
      PIN runs and then projects these values around the torus in a circle to
      generate a 3-D distribution and then calculates which part of the grid a
      toroidal observation line cuts - to calculate the contribution to the 3-D
      LOS plot. (Note: I am not certain that this is what is done.)</P>
    
    <P>The input routine for these plots reads two lines of data containing the
      following information.</P>
    
    <P>Line 1: Robs Zobs Cx1 Cy1 Cz1 Cx2 Cy2 Cz2 qres</P>
    
    <P>These values are interpreted as the R,Z position of the start of the
      LOS. The values (Cx1,Cy1,Cz1) and (Cx2,Cy2,Cz2) are the directional
      cosines of the extremes of the viewing fan. The value qres is the width of
      each of the LOS integrals that will be performed for each LOS between the
      two extremes of the viewing fan. </P>
    
    <P>Line 2: Nq Avpts Smooth Izmin Izmax Atype</P>
    
    <P>Nq is the number of viewing chords that will make up the fan. The
      direction cosines of each of these LOS between the two extremes of the fan
      are calculated. Avpts is the number of LOS that will be averaged over for
      each of these primary LOS. There will be 2*Avpts -1 lines calculated over
      an angle of qres for each of the viewing LOS. Since this plot is intended
      solely to plot PIN H-alpha, the value for Izmin is set to zero and the
      value of Izmax is ignored. The code for this plot could be used as a
      template for further 3D plot development and calculation. (Assuming that
      the code works for more than a specific subset of cases and geometries.)

    <P>This set of plots was developed by Peter Schwanke as part
    of his Master's thesis to examine in detail the force balance on 
    impurity particles. In particular, the plots can be used in 
    conjunction with the Reiser force formulation for ion 
    transport to look at the differences between this formulation and 
    the standard DIVIMP methodology. These plots can also be used as
    a diagnostic tool for looking at some general characteristics of
    the impurity particle behaviour, trapping and parallel transport
    in particular. </P>

    <P> The first series of plots present contour depictions of the various 
    forces and force balances including the frictional, temperature 
    gradient and velocity gradient forces. </P>

 <P> The following series of plots were also developed by Peter 
 Schwanke. In this case they display the balance of forces for  
 a specifiec impurity charge state. The impurity ion velocity is 
 required to produce a specific and accurate plot. Two different 
 possibilities can be chosen. Two different plots display two 
 simplified velocity assumptions. Vimp = 0 and Vimp = Vb. As can 
 be seen in the examples - both the ring number (fkux tube) and 
 the charge state of the impurity are inputs to these plots.</P>

      minimum and maximum values for all data to be plotted are calculated and
      are used for scaling the axes. </P>
    
    <P>Scaling Option 2: ON - The minimum and maximum are calculated for each
      plot on the page and these values are used to scale the axes for each of
      the plots independently.</P>
    
    <P>Scaling Option 3: ON - The maximum is calculated from all data to be
      plotted. The minimum is set to 0.0 unless there are values in the data
      which are less than zero in which case these values become the minimum
      values for the scaling.</P>
    
    <P>Scaling Option 4: ON - The maximum is calculated for each plot on the
      page separately. The minimum for all plots is set to zero unless the data
      values to be plotted cross the axis. </P>
    
    <P>Scaling Option 5: ON - Logarithmic Scaling. The log10 of all data values

    <P>These numbers are interpreted in the following way. </P>
    
    <P>Ng - Number of Graphs on each page. Plots are formatted into two columns
      and thus typical numbers for this quantity would be 2,4,6, or 8. The plots
      get much smaller as the number on each page increases. In this example - 6
      graphs/page have been selected.</P>
    
    <P>Tp - Total Number of Plots to be generated. In the example above, three
      pages of plots would be produced with 6 plots on each page. The first page
      will always contain the maximum possible. Thus, if ten plots were
      selected, the first page would contain six and the second four.</P>
    
    <P>Zf - Zoom factor. This specifies the zoom factor that should be applied
      to all graphs in this set of plots. A value of 0.0 indicates that no zoom
      factor should be applied and all plots should be displayed over the entire
      range of each field line. A value less than zero (e.g. -0.05) specifies
      that all the plots produced should be close-ups near the target at the
      start of the field line from 0.0 m to |Zf| * SMAX. In this case, if
      Zf=-0.05, the plots would be close-ups from 0.0 to 0.05 * SMAX. If the
      value of Zf is greater than zero then the close-ups are made at the other
      end of the ring from (1.0-|Zf|) * SMAX to SMAX.</P>
    
    <P>Rings- This entry specifies the list of rings for which the plots of the
      specified quantity should be produced. There should be exactly as many
      rings listed as the Total Number of Plots requested (Tp). These rings can
      be from any area of the grid and there is no requirement that they share
      the same X-axis scaling. </P>
    
    <P>In all of these plots, both the values saved for the DIVIMP results and
      the EDGE2D data (if loaded for comparison) will be plotted. If the EDGE2D
      data has not been loaded in DIVIMP, then the EDGE2D data plots will be
      zero - just the DIVIMP ones will be non-zero. However, since these plots
      still plot the DIVIMP background plasma data, they provide an efficient
      method of examining the details and variations of the background plasma
      that has been used for the DIVIMP run. In addition, there are a number of
      &#147;Along the field line&#148; quantites that are generated by DIVIMP
      that could profitably be displayed using this type of plot. (The impurity
      density along the field lines as a function of charge state is one example
      that comes to mind.) However, development of these alternate plot options
      has been left for a future date, the existing code may be used as a basis
      for addig these plot types if they prove to be needed. </P>
    
    <P>The following quantities can be plotted using these graphs - Ne, Te, Ti,
      Vb, G, ionization source, cross-field density gradients, cross-field Te
      gradients, cross-field Ti gradients, EDGE2D vs. various calculated
      G-values from SOL 22, actual and expected pressure from SOL 22, particle
      sources from PIN - ionization and recombination.</P>

    <P>There are seven different plots in this series. Each plot displays the
      same basic information - the values of Dperp and Xperp found by the Dperp
      extractor for the background plasma used for this case. Dperp and Xperp
      are calulated for each ring in its entirety and for each half of a ring
      (Inner and Outer) calculated independently. Each of these diferent numbers
      can be displayed. They are plotted as a function of the ring separation at
      the outside mid-plane of the reactor (for JET) - inside mid-plane
      otherwise. Please note that the INSIDE/OUTSIDE terminology used here is
      dependent on the grid used in the case. The following plots are available:</P>
    
    <P>751 One graph containing both Dperp and Xperp(E,I,Total) plotted with a
      common axis.</P>
    
    <P>753 One graph containing Dperp, Xperp(E,I,T) calculated for the OUTER
      half ring.</P>
    
    <P>755 One graph containing Dperp, Xperp(E,I,T) calculated for the INNER
      half ring.</P>
    
    <P>757 Four graphs/page multi-plot containing Dperp and Xperp(E,I,T)
      calculated over the whole ring.</P>
    
    <P>759 Three graphs/page multi-plot containing Dperp and Xperp(E,I)

    <P>763 Two graphs/page multi-plot containing Dperp and Xperp(T) calculated
      for the whole ring.</P>

    <P>793 Four graphs/page displaying the whole ring values of the transport
      coeffcients against the R-coordinate at the outer mid-plane. Scaling for 
      Dperp is fixed at [0.0,0.3] and scaling for Xperps is set to [0.0,3.0]</p>

    <H3><A NAME="plot781">Multiple Radial Plots for Cross-Field Gradient Comparisons (FC to DIV) (781-791)</A></H3>
    
    <P>These are a specific set of plots for various quantities that use the
      plotting format developed for the 701 to 723 series plots. These plots
      diplay the radial variation of a variety of quantities at every knot along
      all the rings of the SOL. Each individual graph uses the distance of cell
      centre separation, starting with the zero point being the centre of the
      cell lying on the separatrix, and proceeding outward radially for constant
      knot values, as the horizontal plotting axis. These plots produce graphs
      for every knot in the SOL - thus there are usually 40 or more graphs
      produced with 8 graphs plotted on each page. The plots can be very
      revealing when comparing OSM vs. EDGE2D solutions. In addition, they can
      be quite useful for analysing the cross-field gradients that one would
      expect would be responsible for the cross-field particle source flows. The
      quantities that can be plotted in this manner are Ne, Te, Ti, &Ntilde;cfNe,
      &Ntilde;cfTe, and &Ntilde;cfTi. </P>
