    <P>The purpose of this manual is to provide information that will enable a
      reader to compile, execute and to monitor the execution of DIVIMP cases.
      There are several different possible strategies to allowing multiple users
      access to the DIVIMP directories. In order to protect the code itself and
      the shell scripts which run it, it was decided to make individualized
      copies of the shell scripts for each user. These shell scripts will run
      the code in the user's home directory. They will also obtain the data
      files, which control the simulation, from a subdirectory in the user's
      home directory. However, all results can be stored in the standard DIVIMP
      results directory, which can be read and written by all users. This will
      make it possible for all users to erase old results files if the disk
      space becomes limited while preserving the ability of each user to run
      their own cases in an independent fashion. It is the responsibility of
      each user to keep track of the amount of disk space being used by results
      files and to delete and/or back them up on a regular basis. It is also up
      to the users to cooperate in scheduling the CPU usage in order to most
      efficiently utilize the machine resources. Different sites running DIVIMP
      will have different policies. </P>
    
    <P>This manual describes the general DIVIMP installation in Toronto on an
      IBM RS6000 workstation which runs a variant of the UNIX operating system
      known as AIX. It does not apply to installations like that on the IBM3090
      at JET (though it may apply to the installation on the JAC cluster at
      JET), or a typical Cray installation. Other UNIX workstations using the
      default DIVIMP installation will have an organizational structure that is
      similar to the one used here. </P>
    
    <P></P>
    
    <H2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H2>
    
    <P></P>
    
    <P>The DIVIMP simulation code is used to model impurity ion transport in
      the edge plasma region of Tokamak fusion devices. The code itself is
      composed of several different modules which, in general, fulfill discrete
      purposes. The code was written in such a way as to allow all of the basic
      parameters of the simulation to be changed with ease. This functional
      ability mandates that each DIVIMP run requires an input data file which
      specifies all of the options for the particular case being simulated. In
      addition, the companion code, OUT, produces all of the graphical output
      associated with the DIVIMP run. It too requires an input data file which
      contains descriptions of the number, type and characteristics of plots
      desired for the case being run. The whole process of running these codes
      can be most easily dealt with by placing all the necessary commands in one
      file called a &quot;shell script&quot;. This file contains the series of
      UNIX commands that will first create a directory for the code to run in,
      copy all necessary files to this directory, execute the DIVIMP code, move
      some files to the results directory, execute OUT, move the rest of the
      desired files to the results directory, send the postscript files to the
      printer, if desired, and finally delete the temporary directory that was
      created for running the code. </P>
    
    <P>The following document is structured in such a way as to describe the
      details of the process of executing the DIVIMP code. It includes a
      description of the files and their locations. It then describes, with some
      examples, the DIVIMP and OUT input data files with some suggestions on how
      to change the contents of these to create your own input data files. Next,
      there is a description of the shell scripts that actually run the code;
      what they are called and how they are correctly executed. Then the results
      are discussed; where they are stored and how to access, print or display
      them. Finally, some techniques of job management, including monitoring the
      CPU usage and number of jobs currently executing as well as how to
      terminate the execution of your own jobs are discussed. </P>
    
    <P>For more information on actually building DIVIMP, please refer to the
      description and listing of the Makefiles at the end of the Source Code
      Summary document. </P>

    <P>All of the simulation codes in Toronto are laid out in the /u/progs
      directory tree. The DIVIMP code and related data files, results and
      documentation are kept in the /u/progs/div6 directory. The following is a
      partial list of directories in this tree and the types of files that can
      be found there. In general the /u/progs/div6 prefix will be installation
      dependent and will change from site to site. However, the rest of the
      directory structure should remain the same</P>

    <H2><B></B><A NAME="files">What files are required and what do they do?</A></H2>
    
    <P></P>
    
    <P>DIVIMP requires a variety of supporting data files and programs, some of
      which depend on the options selected within DIVIMP. For example, the PIN
      hydrogenic neutral code is required if one wants to examine the expected
      hydrogenic ionization given the specified background plasma conditions in
      DIVIMP (This hydrogenic neutral code, NIMBUS, only works in conjunction
      with JET geometry files - EIRENE may be used when dealing with Sonnet
      style geometry files.). The ADAS data files would be necessary if the ADAS
      atomic physics package was specified for use or if one was plotting
      radiative emission profiles and wished to use the data for line profiles
      from the ADAS database. In addition, DIVIMP requires geometry data files
      which specify the underlying grid that is used to tally and move the
      particles. These grids are stored in the shots directory and are for
      specific shots on specific machines. Grids are currently available for
      JET, ITER, Asdex Upgrade, CMOD, TdV and DIIID. Finally, DIVIMP requires
      input files that specify the parameter values for the case to be run and
      the list of plots desired. These files are described in greater detail in
      the following section.</P>
    
    <P></P>
    
    <H2><A NAME="setup">The Input files: How to set up a case!</A></H2>
    
    <P></P>
    
    <P>There are two input files that are edited by the user to specify the
      input parameters for running the case. The first is the DIVIMP input file
      that describes the characteristics of the specific simulation. The second
      is the OUT program input file that contains the information specifying
      what plots need to be produced. Typically, the input data files will
      reside in the ~/data directory for the user or in the /u/progs/div6/data
      directory. The names for the files are usually chosen to be somewhat
      descriptive of the set of cases with each separate case in a set having a
      different letter or number. ( e.g. jrecne35.d6i, JET Recycle Neon Series
      case number 35). The case name will be followed by an extension which is
      usually &quot;.d6i&quot; standing for DIVIMP version 6 Input. The OUT
      input files end in the file extension &quot;.d6o&quot; and would typically
      be named after the series to which they applied. (e.g. jrecnea.d6o might
      be used to generate plots for all of the jrecne series cases.) Some series
      will have a very large number of cases in them and as such may be stored
      in a separate directory in the data directory in order to simplify looking
      for case files at a later date. As the code grows and changes, the
      contents of these input files also change since more parameters are
      required for the simulation. The most recent input files will have all the
      parameters required to run the code. It is simply a matter of ensuring
      that the parameters contain values that are correct for the simulation
      that you want to run. There are several quantities that a user needs to
      set each time a case is run in order to avoid confusion. First is the
      title line for the case. This is the first line in the data file and
      generally lists the case number and series identifier as well as some
      particulars about the case. There is no checking done to ensure that these
      values have any relation to the case being run. It is simply a description
      that will be placed on the title of each plot produced and at the head of
      the output data file from the DIVIMP run. The other quantities include
      such things as the number of particles to be launched or injected, the
      background plasma specifications, and a myriad of simulation options that
      are described in detail in the DIVIMP and OUT reference manuals and
      documentation.</P>
    
    <P></P>
    
    <H2><A NAME="execute">Executing DIVIMP: The various shell scripts</A></H2>
    
    <P></P>
    
    <P>There are two commands that are used to run DIVIMP and OUT. These two
      commands are called &quot;rundiv&quot; and &quot;runout&quot;. The rundiv
      shell script issues all the commands to run a DIVIMP case and the process
      the raw data file through the OUT program to produce the plots. The runout
      shell script uses an already existing raw data file and generates a
      selected series of plots for it. The raw data file and the OUT program
      running on it must be compatible versions. The raw data file consists of a
      record of most of the results of the DIVIMP run in a binary data format.
      The routine which writes this file is in the DIVIMP module iodiv.d6a and
      the routine which reads it in is in the OUT module ioout.o6a. If there is
      a discrepancy between the amount and types of data written by DIVIMP and
      those read by OUT then the plotted results are not reliable. This can only
      occur when a code change to the OUT and/or DIVIMP programs has been made
      that affects the raw data file. This problem can arise when trying to
      process very old raw data files with a newer version of OUT.</P>
    
    <P>The exact format of the commands is the following:</P>
    
    <P>rundiv &lt;divimp input file&gt; &lt;out input file&gt; &lt;geometry
      file&gt; &lt;optional Edge2D file specifier&gt;</P>
    
    <P>for example:</P>
    
    <P>rundiv jrecne35 jrecne1 g37943.jun0795 test</P>
    
    <P>The script expects that the file jrecne35.d6i will exist and contain a
      valid description of the simulation parameters. Second, the file
      jrecne1.d6o must also exist and contain a specification for which plots
      are to be printed. Finally, the &lt;geometry file&gt; specification refers
      to files found in the shots sub-directory and which contain the basic
      geometry and magnetic field data for the grid upon which the simulation is
      to be run. The name of this files matches the name entered on the command
      line. Thus the equilibrium file is expected to be called &#147;g37943.jun0795&#148;.
      In addition, the optional specifier, &#147;.test&#148; in this case,
      instructs the script to pre-connect the background plasma file called
      g37943.jun0795.test to the FORTRAN unit number that is assigned for
      reading in the background plasma. (unit 11).</P>
    
    <P>The format for the OUT shell script is similar:</P>
    
    <P>runout &lt;divimp case name&gt; &lt;out input file&gt; </P>
    
    <P>for example:</P>
    
    <P>runout jrecne35 jrecne2</P>
    
    <P>This tells the runout script to work with the raw data from case
      jrecne35. This file is stored in the results sub-directory in a compressed
      data format. The actual name of the file is jrecne35.raw.Z. This is
      uncompressed by the shell script and then used by OUT as it's raw data
      input. This file must exist. The OUT input file, &quot;jrecne2&quot; in
      this example (jrecne2.d6o), must also exist and is found in the data
      sub-directory.</P>
    
    <P>Listings of these two shell scripts are found in the appendix.</P>
    
    <P></P>
    
    <H2><A NAME="output">The Output files: Contents and Meaning</A></H2>
    
    <P></P>
    
    <P>A run of DIVIMP and OUT produces many more files than are typically
      needed. All of the files are listed, in ascending, order by the FORTRAN
      Unit number assigned to them in the code. All of the files are written to
      the results directory by the shell scripts listed above. In addition, the
      file name under which the information is stored is also listed. The files
      which may be automatically printed are listed with two additional names.
      The second is the name of the Postscript file that may be sent directly to
      the printer.</P>
    
    <P><B>fort.6</B> &lt;case name&gt;.lim</P>
    
    <P>This file contains debugging and other information about the DIVIMP run.
      Ancillary tables and data that might be infrequently referred to are
      placed here. </P>
    
    <P><B>fort.7</B> &lt;case name&gt;.dat &lt;case name&gt;.ps</P>
    
    <P>This contains the data file for the case describing the options selected
      and the results obtained for the simulation. The .ps extension file
      contains a printable postscript version of the data file, generated using
      the program a2ps.</P>
    
    <P><B>fort.8</B> &lt;case name&gt;.raw.Z</P>
    
    <P>This is the file containing the raw data from the case. Typically it is
      several megabytes long but is very easily compressed because many of the
      arrays are quite sparse. The &quot;.Z&quot; file extension in the name is
      created by the UNIX &quot;compress&quot; utility.</P>
    
    <P><B>fort.9</B> &lt;case name&gt;.inp</P>
    
    <P>This ancillary file contains a record of various additional aspects of
      the case that has been run. Among these is an echo of the input data that
      can be useful for debugging purposes.</P>
    
    <P><B>fort.17</B> &lt;case name&gt;.pin</P>
    
    <P>This file contains a listing of the background plasma for the DIVIMP run
      in a format suitable for being passed to PIN. (the hydrogenic neutral
      code).</P>
    
    <P><B>fort.21</B> &lt;case name&gt;.sol</P>
    
    <P>This file, if it exists, contains additional detailed output from SOL
      option 22 - if this option was selected to generate the background plasma.
    </P>
    
    <P><B>fort.24</B> &lt;case name&gt;.pinprn</P>
    
    <P>This file contains additional output from a PIN run - if such has been
      executed. </P>
    
    <P><B>fort.62</B> &lt;case name&gt;.bgp</P>
    
    <P>If Print option 10 has been selected inside DIVIMP, then DIVIMP
      generates a background plasma file of the final plasma that is being used
      for the case. This file can then be specified as the input to later DIVIMP
      cases using option 98 of the Plasma Decay, SOL, and Temperature Gradient
      Options. (see DIVIMP reference manual).</P>
    
    <P>After DIVIMP has finished running and the above files have been
      transferred to the results directory (with the exception of the raw file
      which is transferred and compressed at the end after the OUT program has
      run.) the following files are created by the OUT program.</P>
    
    <P><B>fort.6</B> &lt;case name&gt;.out</P>
    
    <P>This contains a record of plots and debugging information for the run of
      the OUT program.</P>
    
    <P><B>fort.9</B> &lt;case name&gt;.ing</P>
    
    <P>This contains an echo of the input fed into the OUT program.</P>
    
    <P><B>fort.26</B> &lt;case name&gt;.grp</P>
    
    <P>This contains tables of numbers for the plots requested, instead of the
      standard plots. This is to facilitate editing of the results and
      processing of them through external means, such as a spreadsheet. This
      file is only produced if the &quot;produce column data&quot; option is
      selected in the output driver file. Note also that a postscript plot file
      is not produced if this file is produced.</P>
    
    <P><B>fort.49</B> &lt;case name&gt;.plt</P>
    
    <P>This file contains additional plotting information or tables for some of
      the plots. </P>
    
    <P>POSTSCPT.LIS &lt;case name&gt;.psg</P>
    
    <P>The file POSTSCPT.LIS is generated by the Ghost graphics package. This
      package of FORTRAN plotting routines which was written by the UKAEA in
      England is used to generate the plots for the DIVIMP runs. Details of the
      library can be found in the Ghost user manual. This is a postscript plot
      file that can be sent directly to the printer.</P>
    
    <P></P>
    
    <H2><A NAME="monitor">Monitoring Execution and Job Management</A></H2>
    
    <P></P>
    
    <P>There are a few commands that are useful for monitoring the execution of
      cases and for controlling or halting the execution of DIVIMP cases. (Some
      of these commands may only apply on RS6000 computers and only if the
      requisite software is installed.) The first command is called &quot;monitor&quot;.
      It will list which processes are currently using CPU time and the portion
      of CPU time that is being utilized by each process. (This is a free
      program available for IBM RS6000 computers. Equivalent programs are
      available on most UNIX based computer systems. Contact your local system
      administrator.)</P>
    
    <P>The form of the command is the following: </P>
    
    <P>monitor -top</P>
    
    <P>The option -top brings up the list of processes and their CPU usage. Do
      not leave this running as monitor also uses CPU time. It is used to spot
      check the load on the computer when you are contemplating starting a case.
      In general, there should be no more than one or two DIVIMP cases running
      at any one time. To exit the monitor program, type the letter &quot;q&quot;.
      It will usually take several seconds to exit. </P>
    
    <P>Another useful command is &quot;ps&quot;. This will list the processes
      that you are currently running. This will include DIVIMP cases as well as
      any other processes you might have initiated. A good form of the command
      is:</P>
    
    <P>ps -f -u &lt;name&gt; Where &lt;name&gt; is your login name. </P>
    
    <P>For example:</P>
    
    <P>ps -f -u pcs </P>
    
    <P>Will list all processes currently running that are owned by user pcs.</P>
    
    <P>One of the columns of the output of the command is the Process ID. </P>
    
    <P>For example:</P>
    
    <P>USER PID PPID C STIME TTY TIME CMD</P>
    
    <P>pcs 8113 10416 0 Jun 13 pts/0 0:04 -ksh </P>
    
    <P>The process ID number of the &quot;ksh&quot; process for user pcs is
      8113. This number is important if one wants to &quot;kill&quot; a job
      before it has completed executing.</P>
    
    <P>In order to kill a process, one would use the kill command. </P>
    
    <P>In the following example the command &quot;ps -f -u david&quot; was used
      to obtain the following table of processes.</P>

    </TABLE>
    
    <P></P>
    
    <P>As can be seen from the output there are two DIVIMP processes currently
      running. These are both indicated by the CMD column which shows the
      command being executed &quot;/u/progs/div6/div6/div6O&quot;. If one wanted
      to kill the second of these processes, read the PID from the table (which
      is 15992). Then use it in one of the following three forms of the kill
      command.</P>
    
    <P>kill 15992</P>
    
    <P>This tells the program to terminate, if the program has a serious bug it
      may ignore this signal.</P>
    
    <P>kill -9 15992</P>
    
    <P>This tells the operating system to kill the program immediately, no
      matter what it's current status. This is almost certain to cause the
      program to stop. </P>
    
    <P>Both of the above forms do not let the program terminate nicely. Neither
      wrap up processing nor file output will be completed. An alternative
      command is the following.</P>
    
    <P>kill -USR1 15992</P>
    
    <P>This will send the USR1 signal to the DIVIMP process. Code has been
      added to DIVIMP to trap this signal and do some completion processing
      before exiting. Results will be unusable except for debugging purposes,
      but by using this method it may be possible to determine what was going on
      in DIVIMP when the signal was received, based on the type and amount of
      data printed out.</P>
    
    <P>Another useful command, which is used to clean up the results directory,
      is called clean. This is a simple shell script which will delete the
      ancillary results files for a case, keeping only the &quot;.dat&quot; file
      from FORTRAN unit 7 and the compressed raw data file. This is sufficient
      information to regenerate various plots or other types of information. It
      is not usually enough for debugging. These are the files that are archived
      for semi-permanent storage, in case they are required at a later time for
      further analysis. (Though changes in DIVIMP and OUT may supersede the
      format of the raw data file. If it frequently occurred that old results
      were needed, then a version number system could be implemented whereby the
      IO modules of DIVIMP and OUT would know what to read from the raw data
      file. However, at this time, this feature has not proven to be worth
      implementing.)</P>
    
    <P>The form of the command is:</P>
    
    <P>clean &lt;case name&gt;</P>
    
    <P>For example:</P>
    
    <P>clean jrecne35</P>
    
    <P>The above will delete all the extra files associated with jrecne35,
      except jrecne35.dat and jrecne35.raw.Z . There is also a more general
      version of the clean command available. It should not be made available to
      all users. This command, &quot;cleanall&quot;, will delete all ancillary
      files for all cases currently in the results directory. It will leave only
      the two files for each case that the clean command leaves. This command is
      most useful just prior to backing up the entire results directory. After
      the remaining files have been copied to tape, they too can be deleted and
      a great deal of space freed for further modeling. A copy of the &quot;clean&quot;
      and &#147;cleanall&#148; shell scripts is included in the Appendix.</P>
