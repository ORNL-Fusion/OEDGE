    <H2><A NAME="summary">DIVIMP and OUT Source Code Summary</A></H2>
    
    <P>This document describes the contents of the various source files that
      compose the DIVIMP and OUT programs. It gives a general idea of where
      various functional segments of code may be found and gives an outline of
      how the source code is structured. In addition, the second section
      describes how DIVIMP and OUT are built using simple Makefiles. These
      Makefiles are included in the Appendix.</P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="descriptions">Source Code Descriptions</A></H3>
    
    <P>The source code descriptions are organized with a listing of the file
      from the UNIX directory taken on the date that this file was last edited,
      followed by a brief description of the routines that may be found in that
      source code module. The descriptions are further structured by listing
      DIVIMP specific files first, OUT specific files next, common source code
      modules, and finally the common blocks. </P>
    
    <P>One important point to note is that these source files do not follow the
      standard naming convention for FORTRAN files. Instead of having a file
      name extension of &#147;.f&#148;, source code files are split into three
      categories - &#147;.d5a&#148; - is DIVIMP version 5 source code - &#147;.o5a&#148;
      - is OUT version 5 source code and &#147;.u5a&#148; - is common or utility
      source code for version 5. The reason for this naming convention was to
      make the code easily divisible into components even if they occupied the
      same source tree. In addition, this naming convention identifies both the
      relevant version and program component in a concise fashion. </P>

    <P>First module called in calculating the background plasma. This routine
      is called from the tau module and invokes a other modules in turn. Among
      these other modules are plasma.d5a which sets up the initial plasma
      conditions and solascv.d5a or cfd_osm.d5a which invoke other plasma
      solvers.</P>
    
    <Pre>2) 192 -rwxr-xr-x   1 david    staff     192865 Feb 25 15:24 cfd_osm.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This module contains the code for the computational fluid dynamics onion
      skin model solution to the background plasma. It is invoked from the
      sol23.d5a module. </P>
    
    <Pre>3) 40 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff      39886 Sep 24 10:30 cfield.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This module contains the code that calculates the ion cross-field
      transport at each timestep. It is called from the div.d5a module. </P>
    
    <Pre>4) 28 -rwxr-xr-x   1 david    staff      25862 Oct 30 17:12 cxrec.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>Code implementing charge exchange recombination models.</P>
    
    <Pre>5) 256 -rwxr-xr-x   1 david    staff     259477 Mar 09 12:40 div.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This is the main DIVIMP driver routine. The ions are followed within the
      central loop of this module, including all of the events that can occur to
      the ion. (e.g. ionization, recombination, collision with targets, etc.)
      All of the set up of relevant arrays is generally done in other routines
      those the routines are usually called from this module. </P>
    
    <Pre>6) 40 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff      39850 Oct 15 16:08 eirediv.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This module implements all the routines necessary for interfacing DIVIMP
      with EIRENE. The transfer files between the codes are read and written in
      this module. In addition, any conversions to the correct units are also
      done here. DIVIMP is strictly in MKS units - with the exception of eV
      being used for the electron and ion temperatures. EIRENE appears to employ
      a mixture of units. </P>
    
    <Pre>7) 28 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff      28332 Mar 09 11:26 grad.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>Grad.d5a contains a number of routines related to calculating gradients
      on the plasma grid of the various background plasma quantities. These are
      used in a variety of places including some of the background plasma
      solvers and the Dperp extractor.</P>
    
    <Pre>8) 292 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff     298051 Mar 08 10:33 iodiv.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This module contains the primary DIVIMP specific I/O functions which
      read in the input data file (READIN) and which write the raw data file
      (STORE). In addition, it includes the routine PRDATA which prints the case
      summary data file.</P>
    
    <Pre>9) 36 -rwxr-xr-x   1 david    staff      35694 Mar 01 16:15 iztau.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This module contains the code that calculates or calls various other
      routines from either NOCORONA or ADAS to determine the ionization
      probabilities.</P>
    
    <Pre>10) 48 -rwxr-xr-x   1 david    staff      47289 Mar 04 07:32 mon.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This module contains various routines that print out monitoring
      variables, or quantities that have been calculated from the DIVIMP
      results. These results are printed to the data file for the case. </P>
    
    <Pre>11) 200 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff     203026 Mar 09 12:53 neut.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This routine deals with the launch and tracking of impurity neutrals,
      either from a given set of positions or by calculating a distribution
      across the target based on the hydrogenic plasma flux.</P>
    
    <Pre>12) 28 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff      26038 Mar 09 12:53 neutone.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This routine is almost identical to the primary neut.d5a module except
      that it has been modified to deal with tracking only one neutral at a time
      and then immediately return to the ion tracking code when that particle is
      ionized. If the neutral is lost by another mechanism, this information is
      passed back to the main div.d5a particle tracking routine and appropriate
      action taken. The module was added to deal with following impurity ions
      that recombine to form neutrals. </P>
    
    <Pre>13) 84 -rwxr-xr-x   1 david    staff      85293 Feb 19 15:39 pindiv.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This module contains the interfacing code to the PIN/NIMBUS hydrogenic
      neutral code. This includes the routines that read and write the transfer
      files to and from the NIMBUS run and any necessary unit conversions in the
      transferred quantities, the majority of DIVIMP uses the MKS unit system,
      while NIMBUS tends to use cgs. </P>
    
    <Pre>14) 44 -rwxr-xr-x   1 david    staff      42152 Nov 02 13:20 plasma.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This routine calculates the initial background plasma conditions from
      the given input parameters, at least for the simpler plasma
      specifications. It also calls some of the more complex background plasma
      calculation routines based on the input options. The routines in this
      module are typically invoked from the bgplasma.d5a module. </P>
    
    <Pre>15) 20 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff      16737 Feb 25 15:15 redefves.d6a<pre>
    
    <P> Redefves is responsible for redefining the vessel wall that is used inside 
    DIVIMP in order to include any baffles that may be specified in the grid file. This
    routine will be automatically invoked if the NIMBUS wall options are in use. Otherwise,
    the Vessel Redefinition option in the input file must be selected in order for the 
    baffles to be incorporated. 
    
    <Pre>16) 28 -rwxr-xr-x   1 david    staff      25236 Apr 30 1998  rundiv.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>Primary DIVIMP driver routine containing the program entry point and
      some initialization code.</P>
    
    <Pre>17) 28 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff      27309 Oct 23 15:11 sltmp.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This module contains support code for some of the features added to
      DIVIMP by Steven Lisgo. </P>
    
    <Pre>18) 16 -rwxr-xr-x   1 david    staff      15226 Mar 20 1998  sol.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This routine sets the background plasma electric field and flow velocity
      for the simple SOL options. The original SOL options were used to set only
      the background velocity and electric field while the temperature gradient
      options defined the temperature. </P>
    
    <Pre>19) 108 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff     110414 Feb 25 15:23 sol23.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This module is the main entry point to the CFD onion skin model
      background solver. The routines in the cfd_osm.d5a module are invoked from
      here.</P>
    
    <Pre>20) 536 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff     548127 Mar 08 10:32 solascv.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This module contains all the code that implements SOL option 22. This
      option uses a Runge-Kutta method to solve for the temperature, density and
      velocity at all points along the field line. The code in this module is
      initially called from the plasma subroutine in the plasma.d5a module. The
      structure of common blocks and reliance on switches used in this module
      makes the routines that implement SOL option 22 almost independent of
      DIVIMP. Originally, SOL 22 was developed as an independent stand-alone
      code and retains some of the independent characteristics in case it needs
      to be extracted in the future. </P>
    
    <Pre>21) 116 -rwxr-xr-x   1 david    staff     116092 Mar 04 07:08 soledge.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This routine deals with the more complicated SOL options that calculate
      both the background temperatures and density as well as the electric field
      and velocity. Examples would be SOL options 12, 13, 14, and 21.</P>
    
    <Pre>22) 452 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff     461379 Mar 05 08:58 tau.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>The code to read the grids is included here. (This includes code for JET
      and Sonnet style grids as well as two specific examples of an ITER
      double-null grid and an Asdex grid (not Asdex Upgrade - Asdex Upgrade uses
      Sonnet style grids as do CMOD, DIIID and TdV)). Code in the tau module
      also calculates the characteristic times that are used in the various
      collision, heating and friction options. Finally, it also includes much of
      the setup and initialization code and calls to the bgplasma.d5a module
      where the background plasma conditions are loaded or calculated, depending
      on the selected input options.</P>
    
    <Pre>23) 28 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff      25285 Jun 10 1998  theta.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This module contains the various routines that calculate the grid
      non-orthogonality and also calculate the auxiliary orthogonal coordinate
      that is used to enforce orthogonal cross-field transport. This code is
      particularly important for Sonnet grids where the equilibrium file does
      not contain a pre-calculated orthogonal coordinate as is the case with JET
      grids. </P>
    
    <Pre>24) 100 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff     100767 Mar 04 05:23 walls.d6a</Pre>
    
    <P>This routine implements the walls and targets. Most of the code that
      sets up where the material interactions will occur is found in this
      module.</P>
    
    <H3><A NAME="out-source">OUT Source Files</A></H3>
    
    <Pre>1) 44 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff      41746 Apr 01 1998  contin.o6a</Pre>
    
    <P>Contains routines that calculate the contributions to Bremsstrahlung
      radiation.</P>
    
    <Pre>2) 28 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff      28543 Mar 15 10:05 ioout.o6a</Pre>
    
    <P>OUT program I/O routines. Similar to the DIVIMP iodiv module. The code
      that reads in the raw data file in the GET subroutine MUST match exactly
      the code in the iodiv.d5a(STORE) routine. If this is not the case then
      data will be improperly transferred between DIVIMP and OUT. </P>
    
    <Pre>3) 508 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff     519448 Mar 15 17:38 out.o6a</Pre>
    
    <P>Main OUT routine that sets up the arrays of data that will be plotted
      depending on selected options. It consists primarily of a large &quot;IF&quot;
      block, which, based on the index number of the selected plot type in the
      input data file, will call the appropriate routines to generate the
      desired plot of the data.</P>
    
    <Pre>4) 116 -rw-r--r--   1 david    staff     116165 Mar 04 08:02 outplot.o6a</Pre>
    
    <P>The routines in this module were part of the out.o4a module in previous
      releases. However, there are so many IF statements in the out module that
      most compiler optimization routines have trouble with the code. As a
      result, all of the routines that support the calculations of the values to
      be plotted were removed to a separate module that could be optimized
      separately. This module also contains code that finds the cell for a given
      R,Z position. The routines that setup the generalized contour plots -
      before calling the actual drawing functions in the trace module and the
      supporting code for a variety of different plots. </P>
    
    <Pre>5) 64 -rwxr-xr-x   1 david    staff      64663 Jun 10 1998  plrp.o6a</Pre>
    
    <P>Particular line radiation profiles. Contains the data for calculating
      the radiative patterns of certain specific lines of various elements. This
      module was moved from being part of DIVIMP in previous releases. It seems
      more reasonable to include the radiation calculation post-processing code
      in the OUT program rather than in the DIVIMP program. </P>

    <P>ADAS package subroutines for accessing the atomic physics data and
      calculating results based on that data and the temperatures and densities
      from the DIVIMP run. ADAS requires a large external database made up of
      data files containing all of the information for the specific atomic

    <P>System dependent subroutines. This contains most of the subroutine stubs
      to system dependent routines. This system module is set up for an IBM 3090
      running MVS. This module has not been used in a long time and would no
      longer be considered reliable. A few examples of typical system dependent

    <P>System dependent subroutines. This contains most of the subroutine stubs
      to system dependent routines. This system module is set up for a SUN

    <P>This module contains the common utility subroutines used by both DIVIMP
      and OUT. Many of these are simple I/O routines for writing a string
      constant and some number of arguments (real or integer) to a standard
      output file (usually unit 7). It also includes the low level routines for
      reading and writing arrays to and from the raw data file. Finally, there
      are some subroutines for finding the position of a value in an ordered
      array of values and other simple functions. </P>

    <P>The routines in datetime.c and datetime.c.sun are function stubs used to
      call the date, time and random number routines from the C-libraries on the
      respective systems. This was found to be necessary because the random
      number generator that was included with FORTRAN was found to be woefully
      inadequate in terms of spectrum and number distribution. (It was based on
      short integers and so gave only a limited number of possible results
      (including 0.0) and resolving probabilities to only one part in 105. The
      stub routines in these modules are called from the respective sysrs6k and
      syssun modules. </P>

    <P>All of these common blocks contain data used by SOL option 22 in the

      contains the set of activated switches or options that have been specified

      of the arrays that contain the Runge-Kutta coefficients for the method
      used in the solver. This structure of common blocks and reliance on
      switches makes routines that implement SOL option 22 almost independent of
      DIVIMP. Originally, SOL 22 was developed as an independent stand-alone
      code. Once so far, the solascv.d5a module has been extracted and
      implemented as a stand-alone module to test alternate solution methods
      without impacting other DIVIMP development efforts or causing instability
      in the existing code. Code still exists in solascv.d5a to simplify moving
      it back to a stand-alone code if that is ever desired again. </P>

    <P><B><A NAME="building">Building DIVIMP and OUT</A></B></P>
    
    <P>DIVIMP and OUT executables may be built differently depending on the
      hardware and software environments in which the codes exist. There are
      several possible methods, however, for UNIX based environments it would be
      best to use the Makefiles that are shipped with the DIVIMP code. These
      will likely require some local customization but should otherwise suffice
      to build the executables. These Makefiles are setup assuming a standard
      DIVIMP source tree distribution as is described in the DIVIMP USER MANUAL.</P>
    
    <P>One important point to be aware of, almost all of the DIVIMP and OUT
      source files contain the statement or compiler directive &quot;INCLUDE&quot;.
      This feature instructs the compiler to include another source file of the
      given name at that point in the code. This feature is supported in all of
      the environments where DIVIMP currently runs, including UNIX Workstations,
      IBM 3090 and various Cray systems. </P>
    
    <P>The following paragraphs will outline some of the methods that may be
      used to compile the code:</P>
    
    <P>One of the simplest ways of building the executables is to concatenate
      all of the relevant source code modules together and submit this file to
      the compiler. This works but is very inefficient and very difficult for
      the compiler to optimize. </P>
    
    <P>Another alternative is to compile each of the source code modules by
      hand using an appropriate compiler invocation command and then to invoke
      the compile/link stage by hand. passing it all of the object modules that
      have been created by the various compilation processes. This is an onerous
      task and it is the task which Makefiles were designed to replace.</P>
    
    <P>The recommended method is to use the UNIX Make utility and the Makefiles
      that accompany DIVIMP and OUT. These Makefiles are not very complex. They
      do allow for recursive invocation to allow the specification of different
      options for different make targets - this may not work on all versions of
      Make. Makefiles are more efficient than many other methods since Make will
      automatically check file creation dates against the last time the target
      was built and then only recompile those elements that need recompiling.
      This is usually quite efficient. In addition, different compiler options
      and build objectives can be placed in the Makefile to facilitate building
      specific versions of DIVIMP (e.g. building a version with debugging
      options turned on). Finally, it is possible to build in dependency
      checking so that if one source code module is changed, and the changes
      would affect another module, then both would be recompiled. This is
      particularly apropos for changes made to common block declarations where
      the majority of source code modules will need to be recompiled, despite
      there being no direct changes to any of them. This type of dependency
      checking has not been implemented in the current generation of DIVIMP and
      OUT Makefiles. The current policy is to recompile all of the source code
      if a change is made to a common block that is included in multiple source
      code modules. The make is accomplished by changing to the DIVIMP or OUT
      directories and typing the command &quot;make&quot;. The make utility will
      automatically use any file named &quot;Makefile&quot; or &quot;makefile&quot;
      is the present directory and build the default target. If an option is
      passed on the command line to make (e.g. make opt), make will look in the
      Makefile for instructions to build the target &quot;opt&quot;. If no
      instructions are found, make will return an error. </P>
