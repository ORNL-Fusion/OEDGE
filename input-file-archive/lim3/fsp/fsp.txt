Fast Scanning Probe Puff Series
======================================================================

May 16, 1997

This series of cases simulate impurity puffing from the tip of the C-Mod fast reciprocating probe.  

The primary viewing angle gives a field of view of 24 cm poloidally and 32 cm toroidally.  For the LIM modelling, this corresponds to 24 cm in the x-direction (radially in LIM terms) and 32 cm in y-direction, approximatel, since the field pitch had to be taken into account.  Therefore, within LIM, the separatrix is in the poloidal direction, and so poloidal/radial parameters map to radial/poloidal parameters in C-Mod (such as Dperp).  Therefore, the primary qualitiative plot will be the poloidal integration plot, to give a side view of the plume.  This will require some coding to allow for plasma gradients in the poloidal direction - once more realistic plasmas are required/specified.

The probe head is a pyramid with the base 11.3 mm on a side.  The best I can do to approximate this at the moment is a blunt with a 11.3 mm base (and infinite in the poloidal direction) and a 1.5 mm top (to represent the 1.5mm orifice at the top of the probe).  This neglects the additional surface area at the bottom of the pyramid due to the base being circular.

It will be interesting to see what a more realistic source might be.






Case Profiles
----------------------------------------------------------------------

100 SERIES

These are all cases with constant background denisties and temperatures.  There are no impurity sinks and N2 break-up is not included.  The ion and electron temperatures are equal.

Temperatures of 20,40,60 and 80 eV and densitites of 5E19, 1E20, 2E20 and 1E21.

LIM is operating in 3D mode and 5000 particles are followed.

100: 

Standard case

No wall sink action, a point source with radial velocity only.  Dperp set to 1 for both directions.  The blunt limiter probe approximation is loaded, but ions are restricted to x > 0.  NEUT spreading is turned off.

What's this x-drift thing?


110-125: 

Dperp is 1.0 everywhere and there is also no parallel or poloidal flow velocity.

  60	118	119	120	121	
  80	122	123	124	125

130-145: 

Dperp is 1.0 everywhere and a parallel flow velocity of 15000 m/s (0.5M for Te = 20 eV).  Otherwise the same set up as for 110-125.

150-165:

Same as 130-145 except that vpara is set to 7500 m/s.

170-185:

Same as 130-145 except that vpara is set to 30000 m/s.


200 SERIES

Same as for 100 series except that helium is launched as opposed to nitrogen.


300 SERIES

300:

First case with the probe head included.  Unfortunately, LIM limiter specifications do not allow 3D probe geometry at the moment, so a wedge approximation is being used.  The dimensions are taken from a CAD drawing of the probe head that Sanjay sent down.

Outboard flow is set to 0.  

At the moment, I am still not sure what to do for the electric field.

Plasma parameters are the same as for 110.

301:

The same as 300 except that the outboard flow is set to the local sound speed.  I want to see how important the this flow is to the particle sink.
