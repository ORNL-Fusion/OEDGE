After Kim mentioned that you were having some difficulties executing the 
printer control commands, which are useful in cleaning up some problems
with the printer - I looked into it and found that certain permissions
had not been set yet. I have added both you and Kim to the printq group
which should allow you to execute the required commands. Once again though,
the following procedure is best used in a limited number of cases - when the
printer has clearly stopped printing things - this will usually take a 
minimum of 15 minutes with no plot production from the printer - the reason
for the wait is that some plots could possibly take this long - if it is
your file being printed the decision is yours - otherwise it would 
probably be a good idea to wait. In addition, the new priveledges will  
probably allow you to cancel each others print jobs - I hope that you
(meaning all involved, including myself! :-) ) will use restraint in this.

Procedure to restart printer after it has obviously hung up on some data:

1) Issue command :   enq -D    
   (This brings down the printer queue)
2) Cancel the currently printing job using the command:  cancel job#
   (This job is placed at the head of the queue for printing when the
   printer comes back on-line)
3) Unplug and then plug back in the parallel-serial converter/buffer
   (This is located on the desk with the workstation - by the monitor.
    It is the smaller of the two adapters plugged into the power bar. 
    It is the one closer to the door. 
    BE CAREFUL: The power switch for the power bar is right underneath
                this adapter so do NOT push the adapter all the way into 
                the plug - as you might accidently cut power to the 
                system - this would be a BAD thing. :-) :-)
                If you do accidentally cut the power - just turn the 
                power back on and cross your fingers - all executing 
                jobs will likely be lost.)
    (this is necessary because the converter buffers 64K of data - which
     must be cleared - or else the reset of the printer will not be
     effective.)
4) Go to the printer and press and hold the button marked reset for 
   a few seconds until the printer displays the message "resetting".
   Wait for the "Postscript Ready" or "Toner Low" or other informational
   message that indicates the printer is ready to print.
   ("Paper Jam" is not such a message :-) )
5) Go back to the workstation and issue the command: enq -U
   (This will bring the printer queue back up and everything should
    continue printing as it should.)

Enjoy,

David
