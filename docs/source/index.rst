Welcome to the OEDGE documentation!
=================================

.. note::

   This documentation is under active development.

**OEDGE** is a suite of codes used to model the boundary of nuclear fusion devices. This includes the 1D plasma fluid solver OSM and the Monte Carlo impurity transport codes DIVIMP and 3DLIM. The large majority of the code has been written and maintained by David Elder, with contributions from others from around the world.
