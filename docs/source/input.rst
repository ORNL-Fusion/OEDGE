Input Options
=============

OSM and DIVIMP (collectively called OEDGE here) share the same input file as they are two tightly integrated codes that share many of the same options. This inevitably means many options will only apply to OSM and not to DIVIMP, and vice-versa. OEDGE also has a long and rich history of development, thus many input options are considered defunct. 

The input options are separated into "Tags" consisting of a letter and a number, e.g., T13. There are also one set of Tags that start with the number 2 that relate to the SOL22 plasma solver within OSM. Generally, the Tags are supposed to represent a grouping of related input options, but this convention is not always followed.

.. _A01:
A01 : Title
  This entry is composed of two string constants. The first is fixed and simply indicates that the first line of the input file is reserved for the title of the run. The second string, after leaving a space, (See the sample input file), contains a title for the case. Typical contents would be the name and series number and perhaps a reference to a note or other document that would describe why the case was run. These are useful in the future when cross-checking the cases that have been run. The title will appear in all print outs and on plots produced from the output of the case.

.. _A02:
A02 : Case Description
  This input is another DIVIMP character string value. The first string is an identifier tag and the second string should contain a description of the important features or options for the case. This description will be included in the header information of the .dat/.html case file and will be included in the description section of the posted case database. 

.. _A03:
A03 : Equilibrium Grid File Name
  This input line specifies the complete path-inclusive name for the equilibrium file that is being used to run the case. This information is then passed to PIN/NIMBUS, if it is being run, for its use in loading the equilibrium grid. At this time, the information is not directly used by DIVIMP itself. DIVIMP relies on the script file to pre-connect the equilibrium grid to the appropriate input unit number.

  e.g. 'Equil File Name' '/u/progs/div4/shots/g31627.v3'

.. _201:
201 : Force Te = Ti
  0: Off - Te and Ti are calculated separately applying the source terms that are appropriate for each species in the independent heat transport equations.

  1: On - Te and Ti are forced to be equal each other at all points - source terms for the two are combined into one heat transport equation.

.. _202: 
202 : Initially Imposed Target Mach Number
  This is the value of the flow velocity initially imposed at the target as a multiple of the target sound speed. (A value of 1.0 is usually used initially for the target mach number). If the iterative mach solver option is turned on - then the value of the mach number at the target may move from this initial value as the solver searches for a smooth solution at the point of the super-sonic to sub-sonic transition. 

.. _203:
203 : Initial Mach Number Step Size
  When the iterative Mach solver is turned ON the values of the Mach number are initially stepped by this amount as the solver conducts its search. (Typically this value is set to 0.1 - so that mach number solver initially proceeds in increments of 0.1 - trying to bracket the critical target mach number.)

.. _204:
204 : Ultimate Mach Number Resolution
  The solver resolves the Mach number to this level of "accuracy". (Usually 0.00001 is used) . Due to instabilities encountered in the equations, the solution is found to bifurcate at the value of the critical mach number - even for exceptionally small changes in the Mach number of 10\ :sup:`-10` or less. As such, it has proven difficult to actually find a solution that smoothly traverses the transition region when examined on a small scale length. Usually, the solutions containing sonic transitions are adequate given the granularity of the grid on which the simulation is taking place. 

.. _205:
205 : Ionization Source Length Switch
  This option controls the interpretation of the length entries of the ionization source characteristics that are entered below.

  0: Source lengths are interpreted to be in absolute units (meters)

  1: Source lengths are expressed in relative units as a proportion of SMAX for each individual ring

.. _206: 
206 : Start of Ionization Source
  The interpretation of this number depends on the analytic ionization option selected. This number is interpreted as the starting S position (relative or absolute) of the ionization source. In the case of the triangular or rectangular ionization sources there will be no ionization for S less than the value listed here.

.. _207:
207 : End or Length of Ionization Source
  This specifies the end of the ionization source or effectively its length if the ionization source starts at 0.0. All of the source lengths are limited to a maximum of 1/2 of the field line. This is because the solver operates from each target out to the point mid-way from both targets along the field line and would ignore any source contributions outside this range.

.. _208:
208 : Decay Factor or Width of Ionization Source
  This is the characteristic decay length or the width factor of the ionization source depending on which ionization source option has been selected. In particular, this value is used for the decay length of the default Exponential Decay Ionization Source.

.. _209:
209 : Length of the Radiation Source
  Length of radiating source region in meters.

.. _210:
210 : Decay Length of Radiation Source
  Characteristic decay length for the exponential decay radiation source - Prad Option 1.

.. _211
211 : Source Strength Fraction (Frr)
  This specifies the total power radiated by the radiation source term in terms of the power flux onto the target. A value of 3.0 means that the integrated strength of radiated losses will total 3 times the total target power flux for the specific ring.

.. _212:
212 : Garching Radiation Model: Parameter Alpha
  The Garching model for impurity radiation uses the following formula. The quantities Alpha, the base temperature and the two exponents are read from the input data file using these lines. The actual option is selected through the Radiative Source Switch (Prad Option 2) which is found below.
