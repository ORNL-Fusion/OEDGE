.. note::
  Throughout the literature the naming convention of the code and its different parts is not wholly consistent. For the purposes of this document, we will use the following:

  - **OEDGE**: The full suite of codes containing all the source code.

  - **OSM-EIRENE**: The 1D fluid solver used to generate a plasma background. Often just abbreviated as OSM.

  - **DIVIMP**: The Monte Carlo impurity transport code that follows impurities in a given background.
