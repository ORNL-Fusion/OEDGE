F                        ! if true, then the plasma transport calculation is turned off, plasma paramaters as in input.txt
T                        ! if false, turn off internal energy correction in energy sources (T for soledge2D, or use only for debug)
F                        ! source rescaling in minimal model to account for lost flux
