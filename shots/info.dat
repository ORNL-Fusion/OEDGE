DIVIMP Option Description File

[EIRGEOM  0: EIRENE geometry data file option]
Supplied externally.
[EIRGEOM  1: ]
Passed from DIVIMP.
$
[EIRDATA  0: EIRENE input file generation option]
Supplied externally.
[EIRDATA  1: ]
An EIRENE input file is generated by DIVIMP.  The file is based on an existing input file (template file), with modifications made by DIVIMP where necessary.  EIRENE options that cannot be set by input to DIVIMP must be changed in the template file.
[EIRBGK  0: ]
Neutral-neutral collisions are not included.
[EIRBGK  1: ]
Neutral-neutral collisions are included on the standard grid.
[EIRBGK  2: ]
Neutral-neutral collisions are included on the standard grid and throughout the vacuum region.  A "vacuum grid" is generated by DIVIMP and passed to EIRENE via the EIRENE input file.  Generally, the vacuum grid is only available for the region "below" the private flux zone.
[EIRBGK  3: ]
Neutral-neutral collisions are included on the standard grid and throughout the vacuum region.  A "vacuum grid" is generated by DIVIMP and passed to EIRENE via the EIRENE input file.  The vacuum grid cells do not need to intersect the standard DIVIMP grid at grid verticies.
[EIRBGK  4: ]
Neutral-neutral collisions are included on the standard grid and throughout the vacuum region.  A "vacuum grid" is generated by DIVIMP and passed to EIRENE via the EIRENE input file.  The vacuum grid cells do not need to intersect the standard DIVIMP grid at grid verticies.  Neutral species data is not passed to EIRENE for the standard grid, although the data is still recorded after each iteration.
$
[EIROPACITY -1: ]
The recombination rate multiplier passed to EIRENE is set to zero, turning off volume recombination.
[EIROPACITY  0: ]
The effect of Lyman alpha opacity is not estimated.
[EIROPACITY  1: ]
The mean free path of a Lyman alpha photon is calculated for each cell on the standard grid.  For cells where the MFP is smaller than the cell dimensions, recombination rate data that includes the effect of opacity to Lyman alpha photons is used.  When the MFP is on the order of the cell dimensions an ad-hoc linear estimate is used to interpolate between the transparent and opaque data.  The effect of opacity is *not* included in the initial call to EIRENE, since there is no neutral hydrogen density data from which to estimate the MFP (although this is not the case if the present case was continued from a previous one and the supplimentary RAW file was loaded).
[EIROPACITY  2: ]
The mean free path of a Lyman alpha photon is calculated for each cell on the standard grid.  For cells where the MFP is smaller than the cell dimensions, recombination and ionisation rate data that includes the effect of opacity to Lyman alpha photons is used.  When the MFP is on the order of the cell dimensions an ad-hoc linear estimate is used to interpolate between the transparent and opaque data.   The effect of opacity is *not* included in the initial call to EIRENE, since there is no neutral hydrogen density data from which to estimate the MFP (although this is not the case if the present case was continued from a previous one and the supplimentary RAW file was loaded).
[EIROPACITY  3: ]
The mean free path of a Lyman alpha photon is calculated for each cell on the standard grid.  For cells where the MFP is smaller than the cell dimensions, recombination rate data that includes the effect of opacity to Lyman alpha photons is used.  When the MFP is on the order of the cell dimensions an ad-hoc linear estimate is used to interpolate between the transparent and opaque data.  For the *initial* call to EIRENE, where the neutral hydrogen density data needed to estimate the MFP is not available, the *fully* opaque recombination rate data is used.  However, if this case was continued from a previous one and the supplimentary RAW file was loaded, then the neutral hydrogen data is used.
[EIRNUMPAR-HD]
The number of particle tracks that were followed in EIRENE.  Typically, stratum 1 consists of particles launched from the inner target (on DIII-D and C-Mod; the outer target on JET), and stratum 2 is particles launched from the outer target.  Stratum 3 is volume recombination neutrals (unless otherwise noted -- it could also be puffed neutrals at the moment).
$

$
$
[TARSOURCE  0: ]
Target data assigned as per plasma decay option.
[TARSOURCE  1: ]
Probe data loaded but target probe data not applied to target boundary conditions.
[TARSOURCE  2: ]
Target values are assigned using expeimental probe data, with data from the outer probes being used for both targets.  For rings outside the rho range included in the probe data, the data for the closest probe is ued.  Target data multipliers are assigned for the inner and outer targets separately.
[TARSOURCE  3: ]
Target values are assigned using expeimental probe data.  For inner targets that are outside the range of the inner probes, outer probe data is used.  For rings outside the rho range included in the probe data, the data for the closest probe is used.  Target data multipliers are assigned for the inner and outer targets separately.
[TARSOURCE  4: ]
Target values are assigned using expeimental probe data from the corresponding targets.  Inner wall targets use data from the outer divertor probes.  For rings outside the rho range included in the probe data, the data for the closest probe is used.
$
[TARSHIFTOPT  0: ]
The target data shift is applied in the SOL and PFZ.
[TARSHIFTOPT  1: ]
The target data shift is applied in the SOL only.  The PFZ target data is not adjusted.  Depending on the magnitude and direction of the shift that is applied, the PFZ target data may still be used to assign the SOL target data.
[TARSHIFT-HD]
Target data is shifted in "distance along the target" space.  A positive shift moves the data listed in the DIVIMP input file outward (generally in the direction of increasing major radius).  The data for the inner and outer targets can be shifted independently, and the requested shifts are given below.  If SOL22 PFZ ionisation option -6 is used, then the PFZ solution assigned from OSMPPV is applied to the targets before the shifted data is calculated (note however, that the PFZ data will subsequently be reassigned from OSMPPV once the PFZ plasma solution is prescribed, and so will *not* be shifted in the final solution).
$
[PRB_ALIGN  0: ]
Fast scanning probe data not shifted.
[PRB_ALIGN  1: ]
Pressure balance between the outer (CMOD) target and the fast scanning probe is used to estimate the error in the FSP position data.  The FSP position is then corrected.  Plot 219 gives a comparison between target and upstream pressure for the probe data.
$
$
$
[EIRGAUGEHIS-HD]
Pressure gauges are represented in EIRENE by circles (spheres) that are averages over cells in the triangle (tetrahedal) mesh whose centers are within the specified radius. Only data for the last iteration is shown. The gauge history over all iterations is found in the NETCDF file.
$
[EIRNEUTFLUX-HD]
The atomic and molecular flux data returned from EIRENE for hydrogen neutrals is given below.  "Ind" is the surface index in the PIN neutral wall arrays (xVESM), (r,z) is the center of the surface in machine coordinates, "parflx" denotes the particle flux and "avgeng" is the average energy of particles.  Only data for surfaces whose center z-coordinate is below the x-point are given.  The data are from the final EIRENE iteration only.
$
[EIRADDCELL-HD]
Temperature, T (eV), density, n (m-3), and pressure, P (mTorr), calculated by EIRENE on the vacuum grid.  The values listed are the average over all EIRENE runs for this case.
$
[SOLANA-HRADPOW-HD]
Volume integrations of the hydrogenic radiated power as calculated by DIVIMP/EIRENE.   P_rad = P_cool - P_ionization.  The atomic reaction data was taken from the EIRENE AMJUEL database.  "INTEGRAL/m" denotes the integral per meter toroidally.  "INTEGRAL" is the full toroidal integral, with the toroidal circumference calculated using R_x_point.
$
[PARBAL-HD]
Toroidally integrated particle balance for each call to EIRENE.  The effect of representing only a subsection of the torus in the model (EIRTORFRAC<1.0) is included, along with the artificial suppression of the target flux applied in EIRENE (SUPFLX(IR)=1 via RELMODE=2).  This data is also saved in the .raw.rel file under the tag PARBALAN.
$
$
$
$
$
[SOL28-HD]
SOL option 28 specifies the Te along the entire length of the field line and then solves the particle and momentum conservation equations.
$
$
$
[HFLOWPRE-HD]
The hydrogenic flow velocity is based on flow values (Mach numbers) that are specified at descrete locations in the poloidal plane, for example, at the symmetry point and/or the outer midplane.  Sonic flow is assumed at the targets.  The flow along a given ring is then linearly interpolated along the field-line coordinate.  For graphical output of the location of the flow data point, use option 6 with plot 11 or 12.
