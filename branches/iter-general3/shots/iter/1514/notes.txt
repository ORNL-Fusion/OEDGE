Hi Steve,

Enclosed please find an archive (tar+gzip) containing the files you were asking for.

iterm.carre.105 grid in the SONNET format

wlly*.dat               wall geometry in different regions. R,Z are the co-ordinates of the segment ends; Rc, Zc of the segment centers: the rest is irrelevant.

i1514-XX.txt    tables of the plasma data on the grid cells. XX stands for
        na      atomic density
        ne      electron density
        ni      ion density
        nm      molecule density
        te      electron temperature
        ti      ion temperature
        up      parallel velocity
The first two columns are the cell indices in the grid, the next two the co-ordinates of the cell centers followed by the data columns for the components. The components are
        D, He, C        for the atomic quantities;
        D2              for the molecular quantities;
        D+, He+, He++, C+, ..., C6+ for the ionic quantities
Please note also that the parallel velocity is interpolated to the cell centers, whereas the rest of the data are originally calculated there.

Please feel free to ask if something is missing or unclear.

Salut,

AK
