c     All of the HC related variables have been included in modules - 
c     even the actual switch to turn the option on and off - the result 
c     of this is that HC related modules and code need to be included in 
c     a number of places where they are not required - to solve this I am 
c     creating global DIVIMP versions of some of the options so the module
c     inlusions are not required and the HC code impact is limited to the HC
c     files.

      save /global_hc_data/
