    <P ALIGN="LEFT">DIVIMP is a plasma physics modelling code for the
      simulation of fusion reactors. DIVIMP is an acronym which comes from the
      words (DIV)ertor and (IMP)urity. The code was initially designed to
      simulate the behaviour of impurities in fusion reactors which operate in a
      magnetic divertor configuration. Over time the code has evolved so that it
      can model most tokamak magnetic configurations including both limiter and
      divertor geometries. In addition, the code has the ability to calculate a
      hydrogenic background plasma into which the impurity particles can be
      injected if experimental data about the plasma conditions at the targets
      is available. Below are several links that DIVIMP users and collaborators
      might find useful.</P>

        DIVIMP Documentation</A></B></FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT">The DIVIMP documentation consists of a series of manuals
      and guides that describe some of the physics that is involved in the code
      as well as detailed descriptions of the options that may be set for the
      code. The user guide includes information on code installation and
      operation while the reference manuals cover what options are permitted and
      what effect each of these options will have on the simulation.</P>

        DIVIMP Results</A></B></FONT></P>
    
    <P ALIGN="LEFT">This link connects to the directory containing currently
      posted results and a log of recently run cases. This is most useful for
      DIVIMP collaborators who are looking for specific results that have been
      posted. </P>

    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><A HREF="tasks.html">The
        DIVIMP Development Task List</A></B></FONT></P>
    
    <P> The task list consists of DIVIMP development and work items that are either in the queue for
        development, currently under development or being considered for development.</P>

    <P ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT SIZE="+2"><B><A HREF="completed-tasks.html">Completed DIVIMP Development Item List</A></B></FONT></P>
    
    <P> The completed development list is a record of features that have
been implemented in DIVIMP. It is not a complete list since a number of smaller
development items may never reach the task list. However, it does provide
an indication of recent accomplishments and new features which have been added
but may not yet have been documented. </p>
