Hi Steve,

how about the sample input files I sent a few days ago? Are they suitable as templates for the new 80295 scenario?

I finally managed to get a validated data set for the divertor Langmuir probes from a SP sweep in the same plasma scenario (80237, 59.5-60.5s, SP swept -2.5cm, +3.5cm from their stationary position in 80295). The attached tables are already in the format for a DIVIMP input file (psi, jsat [A/m^2], ne [m^-3], Te, Ti [eV].

Unfortunately because of the ISP position we have no data for the wings of the profile. I will try to get another sweep with radial plasma shift in the divertor but at the moment this is all I can do.

If you need more data, please let me know (mid-plane profiles will follow next week, the HRTS data I got here turned out to be corrupt, but I have now some more shots to analyse).

Cheers

Karl
