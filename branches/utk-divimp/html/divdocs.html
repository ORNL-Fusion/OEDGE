<p> DIVIMP is a computer code for modelling the transport of impurity particles in a
fusion reactor. The name comes from the combination of the two words Div(ertor) Imp(urity) 
and describes the code's role in modelling impurities in a divertor equipped Tokamak 
fusion device. </p>

<p>The code has a great many input options that allow for a great deal 
of flexibility in the modelling parameters. Unfortunately, this also leads to a 
significant amount of complexity at the same time. This set of documents is designed to 
help manage that complexity. Every line of a typical DIVIMP input file is described 
in the reference manual. The sample DIVIMP input file contains references directly to the relevant
sections of the reference manual. In this way, any question about the meaning of an input line
can be answered quickly and precisely. </P>

<p> In addition to the DIVIMP and OUT reference manuals. There are number of other documents
which together form the DIVIMP documentation. These are the DIVIMP User Manual which describes
how to setup and run a typical DIVIMP case, the DIVIMP Source code reference which briefly 
describes the basic purpose of each source code module and common block, and the DIVIMP Multi-Site
Code Development document which proposes guidelines for local DIVIMP development. The last 
document is intended to make it easier to re-integrate divergent version of the modelling code
since it is simultaneous use and development at a number of research labs. </p>
